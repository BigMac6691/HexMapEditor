Meta editor is really complex:
=====
editor defines how the user would select the actual meta value to be applied to a map

two basic types would select and input

select could be further refined to droplist and radio and possibly checkbox
    problem with checkbox is the "or" logic, which doubles with each option, and what to draw- what does/could it mean

=====
render rules define the SVG to render on map, borders are complex because of all the edges, corners and variants that are possible

if the renderRules type is "border" then mybe there should be several "border" types
    border_ECV where E is for edges, C is for corner and V is for variant, there for border_EV means just edges and variants

there could also be a simple "icon" type of render rule that draws a single image in the hex
    icon_V would be an icon that has variants
